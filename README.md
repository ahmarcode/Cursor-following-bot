# CursorBOT

This project showcases the integration of a 3D model designed using Spline with a web page that features a title animation and a Firebase-powered view and like counter.

## Features

- **3D Model**: A visually appealing 3D model created using Spline and integrated into the web page.
- **Title Animation**: An eye-catching animation for the page title, adding a dynamic and engaging element to the user experience.
- **Firebase Integration**: Implementation of Firebase for tracking page views and likes, providing valuable insights into user engagement.
- **Like Counter**: A like button that allows users to express their appreciation for the content, with the count stored in Firebase.

## Technologies Used

- **Spline**: A powerful 3D design tool used for creating the 3D model.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The core web technologies used for building the web page and implementing the necessary functionality.
- **Firebase**: A comprehensive app development platform used for integrating the view and like counter functionalities.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-name`
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

Note: You will need to set up a Firebase project and configure the necessary credentials for the view and like counter to work correctly.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation includes a visually appealing 3D model, title animation, and Firebase integration for tracking views and likes, the project is not yet fully responsive. Future updates may include:

- **Responsive Design**: Implementing responsive design techniques to ensure the web page and its components render correctly on various screen sizes and devices.
- **Additional Features**: Exploring new features and enhancements to improve the overall user experience and functionality of the web page.
